I realized I have made a whole set of tools for autogenerating Youtube-movies from  photos and videos from various
cameras.

"linkkaaKaikkiKuvatJaVideot" organizes videos and photos in to timed order into one directory

"normalize-like-hunt" makes uniform colorspace for all photos.

Thereafter I load all files into Cinelerra and do some editing

And lastly I do the "ffmpeg-deshake1" and "ffmpeg-deshake2"

This is an example of the final product : https://youtu.be/UgnFfE_aU18

BTW. Standard ffmpeg does not have deshaker on it. You have to compile ffmpeg yourself with "vidstab"-options on.
